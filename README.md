> This plugin caches your build files locally or in the Netlify cache directory. It will massively speed up subsequent builds.

## ☁️ Installation

```sh
npm install gatsby-plugin-netlify-cache
```

## 🛫 Setup

Add `'gatsby-plugin-netlify-cache'` to the plugins in your `gatsby-config.js` file.

## ✋ Usage

### Locally

In your local environment nothing happens to avoid conflicts with your development process. It actually checks if `process.env.NETLIFY_BUILD_BASE` exists to detect a Netlify environment.

### Netlify

It automatically restores your cache and caches new files within the Netlify cache folder. This folder is [undocumented but works fine](https://www.contentful.com/blog/2018/05/17/faster-static-site-builds-part-one-process-only-what-you-need/#caching-for-the-win). To reset the cache, hit the `Clear build cache` checkbox in the Netlify app.

These folders are cached by default:

* `.cache` directory
* `public` directory


## ⚙️ Configuration

If you need additionals folders to be cached, you can use the option `extraDirsToCache` to include one or multiple folders to Netlify cache:

```js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: "gatsby-plugin-netlify-cache",
    options: {
      extraDirsToCache: ["extraDir", ".extraDotDir"],
    },
  },
]
```
